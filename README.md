Sports Knowledge Based


This is a knowledge based approach on Olympic Sports. This takes in a text file with the name of the sport and multiple 
boolean expressions. After importing the text file the computer asks the user to formulate Logical Questions like : 
"What sports are in the winter and are done individually but aren't racing sports?" This will translate to 
Winter ^ (Individual ^ !Racing)
